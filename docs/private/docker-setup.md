# Docker Installation

## Windows

Docker CE is available through Docker Hub [Here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). This will run on Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise 64-bit as it requires Hyper-V. 

## Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

For *experimentation* and trials, installing Docker can be as easy as:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install
sudo apt install docker.io
```

#### Official Documenation from Docker (Recommended)

For more in-depth installation on production systems, please see [Docker's Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). This will walk you through the process of installing and setting up the Docker Engine on an Ubuntu/Debian based system. 

## MacOS

Docker CE is also available for MacOS. This download is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) and will provide the information necessary for installing Docker. MacOS installs require versions 10.13 or newer (i.e. High Sierra (10.13), Mojave (10.14) or Catalina (10.15). Mac hardware must be a 2010 or a newer model). For odler versions, please see [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) for more information.
