# Photon

Photon is the platform that provides synchronization across various networked Primitive instances. This includes movement of participants, voice, and various actions within the Primitive environment. With both cloud and on-prem offerings, Photon provides an extensible, and stable, platform for networking within Unity.

Photon wraps the various networking layers of each client. Photon Server supports Reliable UDP, TCP, HTTP and Web Sockets with an optimized transfer protocol ([PhotonEngine.com](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Server)). This allows us to easily support object synchronization as well as voice over internet protocol (VoIP).
